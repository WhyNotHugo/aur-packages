This directory contains packages that only provide configuration files.
Most of these I share amongst all my machines, so creating packages
(which are hosted at my own repository) makes syncing configuration
(as well as installing new machines) easiers.  
Of course, these packages aren't upload to the AUR.

Note that these packages **only** contain configuration files that need
to be installed as X. User-level settings are purely handled via git.  
See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/hobarrera/dotfiles) repository if
you're interested in those.
