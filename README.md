# AUR-Packages

This repository is simply the PKGBUILD and related files of packages I maintain for the ArchLinux User Repository.

I've decided to make this public as a reference, and for posterity's sake.
You can find all of these packages in [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=hobarrera).
